These are the instructions for accessing the application.
1. If you have not already installed python, please do. I used version 3.10.11 for the code, so make sure to install the same version. Here is the link to the installation" https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31011/
2. There are several python libraries I used to develop the app. Please install the following using the code provided on your terminal:  
```pip install ShopifyAPI```\
```pip install pandas```\
```pip install requests```\
```pip install PySimpleGUI```\
```pip install jinja2```
3. Once everything is installed, download everything in the github rep aside from the README.md file.
4. Run ```python GUI.py``` on the terminal and everything should work
